        Rex and Charlie were best friends who did everything together. 
        They lived next door to each other with their human families and spent all day playing in the backyard. 
        Rex was a golden retriever, always happy and eager for fun. Charlie was a German shepherd, more serious but very loyal.  
        Every morning, Rex and Charlie would wake up and bark excitedly, ready to start the day's adventures. 
        Their families would let them out into the backyard and they'd run around chasing each other and sniffing for interesting smells. 
        After tiring themselves out, they'd nap in the shade of the big oak tree, Rex's tail still thumping contentedly even in his sleep.
